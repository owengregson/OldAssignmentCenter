# OldAssignmentCenter
A simple chrome extension which reverts the Blackbaud assignment center to the old version.

To install, review the guide shown in my other [Chrome Extension, tranquill.](https://github.com/owengregson/tranquill) Obviously you will install this extension instead of that one, but the process is much of the same.
